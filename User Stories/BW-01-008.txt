Title: Sticky header

User Story: 
As a website user I want to see the header of the website when I scroll down the main page.

Acceptance criteria: 
Given that I still see the header when I scrolled down the page then the header is sticked to the top of the page.

To Do:
Implement a sticky header functionality.

Note:
1) The color of the header should be changed one we scroll down the page and added functionality starts working.
